**Temple of Light** is a computer game in which you have to play with color theory and lights to win. Developed during the Real-Time Ghrapics Programming course at the University of Milan, it shows some graphics effects and materials using shader written in GLSL and WebGL API. 

**Game Mechanics**


**Materials Used**  
Phong material: since it gaves a good polished effect we use this material with the headlight and all the torches around the rooms.

Lambertian material: looking for a more rough appearance we choose to use this material for the table which is theoretically made of wood.
